# MODULE APPOINTMENT

Configuration and providing appointment

The Physical Rehabilitation Centres offer multiple services to Health Service User (HSU). These services may have defined days and times when they are offered. For example Casting run every Monday 10.00 AM- 12.00PM . Appointments are the means by which providers tend to manage their resources and time to offer services to a HSU.&#x20;

Appointment scheduling feature is intended to provide the users the ability to schedule and manage appointments for HSU in a typical ICRC Program set up. With the help of this feature one will be able to:

1. Set up services for a program
2. Create and manage appointments for an HSU

Appointment feature can be used by any users within the Physical Rehabilitation Program and the level of access is defined based on the below set of privileges:

&#x20;1\. Manage Everyone Appointments: Create, Edit and Delete appointments for everyone

2\. Manage Own Appointments: Create, Edit and Delete appointments only for self

3: Manage Appointment Services: Create, Edit and Delete Services (This is to add new service types or make changes to service types in appointments)
