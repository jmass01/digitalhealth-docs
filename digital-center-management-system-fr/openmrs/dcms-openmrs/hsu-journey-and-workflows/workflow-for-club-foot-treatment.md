# Workflow for Club Foot treatment

{% hint style="warning" %}
In this scenario; the HSU will only receive the Foot Abduction Brace, as the serial casting (or Ponseti) will be performed in a medical setting (with sometimes a tenotomy).

For a new HSU who will need a Foot Abduction Brace;

The HSU comes back for the follow up visit, and will have different options through this workflow "follow up": See below the options.

**For this specific clinical scenario, we can streamline the process by allowing a Foot Abduction Brace renewal exception in the workflow to facilitate the work of the clinician.**&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
A: For monitoring, shoe changes, adjustment, repair, or renewing a foot abduction brace within 1-2 weeks, the Episode of service can close at month's end to include follow-up visits.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
B: Maintain HSU activity (keeping Episode of Service in active visit) for 4 weeks between the 1st and 3rd braces to facilitate PRC and caregiver adjustments.

If issues persist, consider returning for recasting.

* If follow-up visits are spaced three weeks or more apart, or fall into different months, the episode should be closed.
