Click on any request in the list to view its details. You’ll see the type of time off requested, the dates, the duration, and any additional notes the employee has included. You can also see the employee’s **remaining balance** for the selected leave type, which helps ensure that the request is within policy. don't forget to "Mark done" the activities when everything is done on the chatter.&#x20;

If everything looks good, you can click the **“Approve”** button to validate the request. If the request isn’t acceptable—for example, due to scheduling conflicts or insufficient balance—you can click **“Refuse”** to decline it. In either case, the employee will be automatically notified of your decision. If more clarification is needed before making a decision, you can leave a note or communicate directly with the employee before taking action.
