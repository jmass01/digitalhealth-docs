Once you're inside the Time Off module, go to the top menu and click on **“My Time Off.”** This section will display your personal leave records. To submit a new request, click on the **“New”** button. This will open a form where you can fill out the details of your leave.

In the time off request form, select the appropriate **Time Off Type**—such as Paid Time Off, Sick Leave, or Unpaid Leave. When you choose a leave type, the system will automatically display the **remaining balance** you have available for that specific category.&#x20;

You may optionally include a short description or reason for your request in the **Description** field. Next, choose the **start date** and **end date** for your leave. The system will automatically calculate the **duration** of your leave based on your working schedule, but you can adjust this if needed.

After filling in all required fields, click **“Save”** if you wish to keep the request in draft mode. When you're ready to submit it for approval, click **“Submit to Manager.”** This will notify your designated manager that a leave request is awaiting their review. This flow can differ based on the configuration on the leave type.&#x20;
