## **ðŸ§­** Context&#x20;

In Odoo, **archiving a product** means deactivating it without permanently deleting it. An archived product will no longer appear in searches, lists, or be available for stock move, or manufacturing orders. However, all past records (such as invoices, stock moves, or manufacturing history) remain intact for traceability.

This feature is useful when a product is discontinued, replaced, or temporarily unavailable, while still keeping its history in the system.

## ðŸ”„ Step-by-Step Flow&#x20;

### Archive a product

The first step before archiving a product is to decide whether you want to archive the **entire product template** (together with all its variants) or only a **specific variant**. If you choose to archive the whole template, all related variants will be archived at the same time.&#x20;

To proceed, open the product form, click on the **Action** button at the top, and select **Archive**. A banner will then appear at the top of the form indicating that the product has been archived.

To archive only a specific variant, click on the **Variants** button to display the list of all product variants. Select and open the form of the variant you want to archive. From there, click on the **Action** button at the top and choose **Archive**. A banner will then appear at the top of the form confirming that the variant has been archived.

### Found an archive product

Depending on the type of product you want to find, access the appropriate list by clicking on the correct menu option at the top â€” either **Products** or **Product Variants**. Both options are available under the **Products** menu.

From the **list view**, click on the **Filters** button to display the available default filters. Select **Archived** to view all products and product variants that have been archived. This allows you to quickly identify and manage items that are no longer active.
