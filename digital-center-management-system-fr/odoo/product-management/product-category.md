# Product category

Product categories play a crucial role in organizing and managing inventory effectively.

Product categories help determine how inventory is valued. Each category can be assigned a specific valuation method such as Standard Price or FIFO (First In, First Out), impacting how the cost of goods sold (COGS) and inventory valuation are calculated.

Product categories facilitate efficient logistics and organization. They allow products to be grouped based on similar characteristics, such as type, function, or usage. This grouping simplifies inventory searches, reporting, and ensures products are stored and managed logically.

Overall, product categories in Odoo are fundamental for structuring inventory management, optimizing logistics, facilitating accurate valuation, enabling detailed reporting, and automating workflows.
