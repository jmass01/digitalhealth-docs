There is multiple way to apply the rules.

* By product, only expense for this specific product will be invoiced for the user
* By product variant, only expense for a very specific product variant( By example sponring only left side ) Find a better example
* By product categ, only expense with the product categories selected will be invoiced to the sponsor
* By SU, If a center is using to do 1v1 sponsoring       &#x20;
* Type of amount can be percentage or fixed amount

If you want to allow the user to update the manual correction you need to check the “Allow manual correction” checkbox. Otherwise the percentage will be fixed.

You can even choose to do the automatic calculation and not to click for every line to the calculation.

Then we need to “Map product”, a new tab “Products” appeared we need to either Activate the product taken I count for the sponsor agreements
