Admission start and end dates can be set to past, present, or future times, which will determine how the admission buttons behave.\


Depending on those dates different behaviour of button will be:

* Both dates are in past: the SU admission will be activated, admitted and discharged with planned dates.\
  Admission will end in state Discharged
* Start date is in past, release date is in future: the SU will be admitted, the bed shown as occupied,\
  Admission will be in state Admitted
* Both dates are in future: The selected bed will be shown as Planned (or reserved) for SU,\
  Admission will be in state Planned

8. Status Update:
   * After activation, the status of the admission record will change to "Plan" for both the main admission and the caregiver(s).

This process ensures that both the SU and their caregiver(s) are properly admitted with accurate tracking of dates and status.
