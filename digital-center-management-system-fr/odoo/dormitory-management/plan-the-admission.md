### Planning the admission

* When the users data are populated, we need to set the start and end plan dates, and check availability of resources.\
  Note that admission state is Draft
* Planing Dates can be entered with time value, (eg: plan discharge of bed @10:00 and next admission on same bed can be @14:00 after cleaning).
* Plan Start and End dates can be entered as current, past or future
* The objective of planing is to position the service user on a bed not occupied or reserved in that period.

You can modify admissions in states Draft (light blue color) or Plan (light green color) with all values

3. Admission in state Admitted (light red color) can oly be modified with Plan end date, nothing else is allowed.
4. With multiple options for planed/occupied/available beds, throughout wards and buildings, the timeline view is provided.\
   The rows represent all available beds, and the columns are dates and times.\
   Timeline navigation options:
   * In order to modify one admission first click on it once, and then
   * Move mouse to left or right border of admission line until mouse icon changes to that side arrow, then click and drag to respectfuly moodify start or end date
   * Move the mouse more to middle of admission line (mouse icon looks like hand) then, click and drag the whole admission ove times and/or beds\
     \- left/right moves the start and end values of admission\
     \- up/down changes selected bed for admission
   * To move trough the timeline, click on grey background to move over beds or periods\
     \- left/right moves the timeline\

## What's next?&#x20;

After planning the admission, the next step is to **formally admit the service user** into the facility, along with any assigned **caregiver**.

During this process:

* You will **confirm the planned admission** and switch its state from _Planned_ to _Admitted_.
* If the service user has a caregiver, you will need to **admit the caregiver separately**, selecting the correct admission dates for each one.
* The assigned bed and other resource allocations will be finalized and locked.
