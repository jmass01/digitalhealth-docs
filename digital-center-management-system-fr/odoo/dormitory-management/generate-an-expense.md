# Generate an Expense

To generate expenses for a patient's stay, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Discharge of All Parties:
   * Before generating expenses, make sure that both the Service User (SU) and the caregiver(s) listed under the "SU Companion" tab have been discharged.
   * If any of these lines are not discharged, the expense line will not be automatically generated and will need to be created manually.
2. Generate Expense:

* Once all relevant parties have the status "Discharged," click on the "Generate Expense" button at the top of the screen.

2.
   * The system will generate expense lines based on the admission and discharge statuses. For example:
   *
     * If both the SU and one caregiver are discharged, it will generate two lines—one for the SU’s admission and one for the discharged caregiver.
     * If only one caregiver is discharged, only that line will be generated.
3. Access the Expense Tab:
4.
   * After clicking "Generate Expense," a new tab named "Xpenses" will appear.
   * This tab will contain all the generated expenses for the patient and caregiver(s).

This process ensures accurate billing by generating expenses only for the admissions and caregivers who have been fully discharged.
