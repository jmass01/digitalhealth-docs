## **ðŸ§­** Context: <a href="#context" id="context"></a>

The caregiver creation feature is designed to support the proper follow-up and care of Service Users (SUs) who require assistance. In many cases, a Service User may be accompanied by a relative, friend, or helper during their stay or treatment. To ensure clear records and proper planning, it is important to register these caregivers in the system. This allows the organization to manage admission schedules, track presence, and coordinate care more effectively. The creation of a caregiver is therefore a key step in building a complete and accurate profile for the Service User.

## ðŸ”„ Step-by-Step Flow

### Access the SU Form

To create a caregiver, you must first access the correct Service User (SU) record. This ensures that the caregiver is properly linked to the appropriate SU in the system.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Create the caregiver

The first step is to check whether the checkbox labeled **"Has caregiver"** is selected.\
If it is not, click the **Edit** button at the top left of the screen to enter edit mode, then check the **"Has caregiver"** box.

If this box is checked, you will see a tab labeled **"Caregiver(s)"**. From there, you can view all caregivers associated with the Service User (SU) or create a new one.

When creating a caregiver, you must fill in mandatory fields such as **name**, **family name**, and **gender**. The other fields are optional but help to better track and identify the caregiver. You can click on "Save\&Close" or "Save\&new" if you have to create multiple caregiver.&#x20;

## What's next?&#x20;

Once the caregiver has been created and linked to the Service User, they will appear in the list of available caregivers. From now on, this caregiver can be easily selected and added during future admissions, ensuring proper tracking and coordination of support for the Service User.
