### Processing the receipt order

Begin by ensuring that the correct SU has been selected in both the **"Receive From"** and **"Owner"** fields. This ensures that the product being returned is properly linked to the right Service User.

Make sure the **Destination Location** is set to **"WH/Repair"**, which indicates that the product will be received in the workshop for repair.

In the **"Operations"** tab, add a new line with the product that needs to be repaired (e.g., a prosthesis).
