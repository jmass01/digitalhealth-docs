## Roles recommended :  Benchworker / Storekeeper

## **🧭** Context&#x20;

This step happens **after the repair order has been confirmed**. At this point, all the repair details are already filled in. The system will reserve the products needed for the repair. Then, the **Storekeeper** prepares these items and gives them to the **Technician**. Once the materials are ready, the technician can start the repair. This part of the process makes sure that everything needed for the repair is available and ready to use.

If the configuration is correct, all components in the list should be in the "Waiting Another Move" state, indicating that a transfer is in progress to replenish the repair stock.&#x20;

The next step involves the storekeeper, who needs to go to "Resupply Repair" in the Inventory module to validate the transfer once the user collects the components. This step follows the standard stock move process, which you can review in detail \[here].

### Validate the resupply order

## What's next?&#x20;

Once the repair is completed, the next step will depend on how your center is set up:

* If your center uses a **Quality Control** process, the repaired product will go through a quality check before it can be delivered. This step helps ensure that the item meets the required standards.
* If there is **no Quality Control step**, you can move directly to the **Delivery of the repaired product** to the Service User.

Both options are part of the final steps to make sure the Service User receives a functional and properly tracked item.
