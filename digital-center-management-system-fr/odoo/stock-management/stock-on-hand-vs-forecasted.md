# Stock on hand vs Forecasted

In Odoo, "Stock on Hand" represents the actual quantity of a product available in inventory at any given moment. It is determined by the physical count of products in stock, updated through transactions such as receipts from suppliers, internal transfers between locations, sales to customers, and adjustments for damages or discrepancies.

On the other hand, "Forecasted Stock" in Odoo is a projection of future inventory levels based on planned transactions and anticipated demand. It takes into account pending purchase orders, manufacturing orders, sales orders, and forecasted demand to estimate how much stock will be available in the upcoming periods. Forecasted Stock helps businesses anticipate inventory requirements, plan production schedules, and make informed decisions regarding procurement and inventory management

The key difference between Stock on Hand and Forecasted Stock lies in their temporal perspective and calculation basis. Stock on Hand reflects current inventory levels based on actual transactions and physical counts, while Forecasted Stock looks ahead by predicting future inventory positions based on planned transactions and expected demand.
