# Stock locations

In many centers, there are typically three primary stock locations:

1\.     Daily Usage / Shop

This location serves as the primary stock area where all products are stored for regular use and immediate access. It is the central hub where items are readily available for sale or distribution to customers and staff daily.

2\.     Workshop location

The workshop location is dedicated specifically to manufacturing operations. It houses materials and components needed for production orders. While some centers may not have a physical distinction between the main stock and the workshop, in the system, it is crucial to maintain a separate inventory to accurately track materials used exclusively for manufacturing purposes.

3\.     Repair location

This stock location is exclusively designated for repair components and products that require servicing. It serves as a specialized area where returned items are assessed, repaired, and prepared for reintegration into inventory or return to customers in optimal condition.

The names of these locations can vary based on the language used and the specific practices of each center. Additionally, some centers may include additional locations such as dormitories or food storage areas, each serving specific operational needs within the facility.
