# Materials Request for other product

{% hint style="info" %}
## Roles recommended :  P\&O, Benchworker

## **üß≠** Context&#x20;

This flow should be followed to create a material request for any product that is not manufactured internally, such as bandages, medication, or other consumables.&#x20;

It serves as a simplified process to record and track which non-manufactured items have been provided to the Service User like bandage, medicaments or any other items.

&#x20;By following this flow, you ensure that these distributions are properly registered in the system, supporting both inventory accuracy and traceability of care-related materials.

## üîÑ Step-by-Step Flow&#x20;

### Create the request

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Via the SU management" %}

Inside the SU form, you'll find a button labeled "**Create delivery**". Clicking it will create a new delivery order associated with that specific Service User.

On the home page, go to the icon "Inventory".

You can view a list of all operation types from this page. Locate the operation type usually called **"Delivery order"**. Within this section, you'll find several useful links: a button that takes you to deliveries ready to be processed, a number indicating how many pickings are currently waiting on another transfer, and another number showing the count of late pickings.
