# Request new component for recasting (optional step)

Rajouter une note ou une remarque pour le recasting.

To request new components for a recast, you have two options:

1. Duplicate the last Picking Component (PC):
   * Return to the Manufacturing order and open the transfer from the previous step.
   * Click on Action > Duplicate at the top.
   * This creates a new transfer with the correct products. Then, check the “Is Recasting” field.

2.
   * Populate all required products and check the “Is Recasting” field.

In both cases, validate the request as outlined previously.
