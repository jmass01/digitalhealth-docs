<summary>Odoo - Using correctly the Search bar</summary>

1.  #### üîç Using Filters and Advanced Filters

    Filters in Odoo allow you to quickly narrow down lists based on specific conditions. For example, in the Delivery Orders list, you can apply a filter like _Status = Waiting_ to only see transfers that require your attention. \
    \
    For more complex needs, use the _Advanced Search_ feature. This allows you to create custom conditions‚Äîsuch as filtering by _Customer_, _Scheduled Date_, or even _Lot Number_‚Äîgiving you precise control over the data you view.
2.  **üóÇÔ∏è Using the "Group By" Feature**

    The _Group By_ tool is useful when you want to visually organize records by a certain field. For instance, grouping deliveries by _Status_ helps warehouse staff see how many are _Ready_, _Waiting_, or _Late_. You can also group by _Responsible_, _Location_, or any custom field relevant to your flow. This is especially handy when managing large datasets, as it gives a structured overview at a glance.\

3.  #### ‚≠ê Creating and Saving Favorite Searches

    If you frequently use the same combination of filters or groupings, you can save them as a favorite search. After setting up your view (with filters and optional Group By), click the star icon next to the search bar and select _Add to my favorites_. You can also check _Use by default_ to automatically apply it each time you open the view. This is a great way to streamline daily operations and ensure consistency across team members.

<summary>Odoo - Access Multiple Odoo Accounts Simultaneously</summary>

Odoo does not support logging into two different accounts in the same browser session.\
To work around this, you can use a different browser or open a new Incognito/Private window to access the second account.
