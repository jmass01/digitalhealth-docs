# INTRODUCTION

Objectives of this chapter for the reader are:&#x20;

3. To be able to log in in the application&#x20;

## Overview

### The Digital Centre Management System is an Innovative digital solution for Physical Rehabilitation Centers.&#x20;

The Digital Centre Management System (DCMS), developed with ICRC's assistance, remains copyright-free, allowing Centres continued use after ICRC support ends. DCMS enhances efficiency in Physical Rehabilitation Centres and supports data reporting. The DCMS will replace the PMS which is now obsolete, unsupported, and limited to Internet Explorer, which is no longer functional as per Microsoft.&#x20;

Consequently, PMS will be decommissioned.  Once the decision is made to deploy DCMS, data from PMS will be migrated to DCMS.&#x20;

## Purpose of the guide

Since 2021, the Physical Rehabilitation Program has been using the Digital Clinic Management System (DCMS) in ICRC and ICRC-supported Physical Rehabilitation Centers (PRCs). The primary goal of the DCMS is to replace the outdated Patient Management System (PMS). This guide is organized into sections to offer detailed information about the DCMS application, leading you through a user's experience in a PRC

* OpenMRS: the OpenMRS is the Electronic Medical Record, where the PMS data will migrate during the deployment. It also contains  the appointment module and the reporting system.
* Odoo: the OpenMRS is synchronized with the Odoo&#x20;
* Superset



Target audience

It is for staff working in Physical Rehabilitation Centres that include clinicians, managers, and administrators.&#x20;

They will be trained on the applications usage after the decommission of the PMS and data migration.&#x20;
