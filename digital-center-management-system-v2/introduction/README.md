# INTRODUCTION

## Overview

### The Digital Centre Management System is an Innovative digital solution for Physical Rehabilitation Centers.&#x20;

The Digital Centre Management System (DCMS), developed with ICRC's assistance, remains copyright-free, allowing Centres continued use after ICRC support ends. DCMS enhances efficiency in Physical Rehabilitation Centres and supports data reporting. The DCMS will replace the PMS which is now obsolete, unsupported, and limited to Internet Explorer, which is no longer functional as per Microsoft.&#x20;

Consequently, PMS will be decommissioned.  Once the decision is made to deploy DCMS, data from PMS will be migrated to DCMS.&#x20;
