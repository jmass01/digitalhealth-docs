The Digital Centre Management System (DCMS) is a unique solution, developed for the Physical Rehabilitation Program within the Program Humanitarian Impact Investment (PHII), transversely with Pearl, to Support Rehabilitation Centres to function in a more efficient and autonomous way. &#x20;

It consists of two digital tools: an Electronic Medical Record (EMR – “OpenMrs”) and an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP – “Odoo”) that will improve quality of services and the global Physical Rehabilitation Centre’s management by providing the partners with a sustainable tool they can use independently and will enable them with the technology needed for that purpose. Through the EMR application, you will have an appointment module that enables you to give an appointment to the Health Service users and DCMS users. An additional application has been added recently called the “SuperSet” to optimize the data collection. &#x20;

DCMS is meant to be used independently by our ICRC partners and PRP centers, as well as by other healthcare departments, as long as the tool answers clinicians requirements.

Superset made by Apache is an open-source solution that allows to visualize and explore data. It’s a powerful yet easy to use solution to connect with many different datasets and combine them into one visualization tool, so or a dashboard. It comes with plenty of visualizations that are already pre-installed.
