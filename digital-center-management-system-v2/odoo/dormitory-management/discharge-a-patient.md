**Discharge on a Past Date:**

* If the discharge date is in the past, first update the Discharge Date to the correct past date.
* After updating the date, click the "Discharge" button to finalize the process.

This ensures that the discharge is recorded accurately, reflecting the correct date of the patient's departure.
