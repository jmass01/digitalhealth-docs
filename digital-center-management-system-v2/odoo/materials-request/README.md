# Materials request

In this section, we will explain the flow of the Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) process in Odoo, specifically for handling a service user requests for medical devices such as prostheses, orthotic, crutches, wheelchairs, walking aids or other materials.

Prerequisite

The process begins when a service user requests a specific device. This triggers a series of steps to ensure the requested item is properly configured, manufactured, and delivered.

MRP Process Flow

1. Identify the service user\
   Locate the service user in the "Service User Management" menu.
2. Configure the Bill of Materials (BoM)\
   Create a BoM configuration to define the product attributes (e.g., side, size, color).
3. Validate the Configuration\
   Confirm the configuration. In some cases, a superior’s validation is required to proceed with the manufacturing order.
4. Stock Allocation\
   Retrieve the necessary components by moving stock from daily usage inventory to the workshop.
5. Manufacturing Process

* Start the manufacturing order.
* Process each work order step-by-step.
* In certain cases, an additional validation by another person may be required.

1. Complete the Manufacturing Order\
   Finalize the manufacturing process once all work orders are completed.
2. Deliver the Device to the service user

* Go to the service user form.
* Check for an open delivery and complete the delivery process.
